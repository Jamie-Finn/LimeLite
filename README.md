# LimeLite

LimeLite is a lightweight and simple HTML5 and CSS boilerplate with a flexible grid system included. Greatly inspired by the [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) and [Lemonade Grid system](http://lemonade.im/).

## Installation
Clone `git clone https://github.com/Jamie-Finn/LimeLite.git`

## Usage
Everything you need to get started is already provided. No installation required. The documentation for HTML5 Boilerplate and Lemonade go into much more detail on how to use them if you are unfamiliar with the code.

With the Lemonade Grid system all I did was change '.bit-' to '.col-' as that is my own personal naming preference for the classes.
